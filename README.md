Why does `cargo` 🏃‍♀️ run, when 🏃‍♀️ running is slow?🤔
[Countless crustacians🦀](https://www.reddit.com/r/rustjerk/comments/11f76c1/im_confused_by_cargo_run/) 
have been confused -- nay, even traumatized 😭 by this injustice.
Cargo should 🚀fly🚀.
Rust is a 🚀blazingly🚀 fast🗲 language, and it should be reflected in its package manager.

Now, you can bring this feature to your dev environment, too. Just install `cargo-fly`, and your fast can be 🚀blazing🚀 too.
